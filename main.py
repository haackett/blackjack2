# Players are dealt two cards
# Dealer is dealt two cards where the second is hidden
# Check for Blackjacks
# Iterate through players asking for hit or stay
    # check if player busts
# Reveal Dealer's hidden card
# Check if val(Dealer's hand) <= 17
    # if not then hit until <= 17 or bust
# If dealer busts, then all non-busted players win
# else, compare val(playerhands) to val(dealer)
# players that are greater and not busted win
